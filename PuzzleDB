		Backstory And Goal
  There are series of mountains in Transilvania which soar 15000 feet or higher into
 the sky.These are called the "Scary mountains". Using only the clues below, match 
 each mountain to its elevation (in feet), and determine who was the first to climb 
 each mountain and when. 
  Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will 
 ever be used more than once. Click one time for "X" as a "false" answer, and click
 another time for "O" as a "True" answer.
 If you get stuck or run into problems, try the "Clear 
 Errors" button to remove any mistakes that might be present on the grid, or the
 "Hint" button to see the next logical step in the puzzle. It is possible to get 
 up to 3 hints throughout the game.
